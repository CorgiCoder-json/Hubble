# Hubble

An FRC data analysis tool that takes a CSV file and gives customizable insights about the scout data. **Currently under development**

# Problem

Scouting is a huge part of FRC. How much a team can score, how good they are on defense, speed, and cycle efficiency are just a few of the many data points collected by FRC scouters all over the world. With this data, many teams use public scouting apps to help gather and structure the data. While some include data analysis features, some do not include such features, and not all structured data outputs are the same. This is where Hubble comes in, providing insights and analysis to help a team create a strong picklist and understand other teams capabillities to the fullest. Huge shoutout to [SPOT](https://github.com/HuskieRobotics/SPOT), [ScoutingPASS](https://github.com/PWNAGERobotics/ScoutingPASS), and [The Purple Warehouse](https://thepurplewarehouse.com/) for being the inspirations for this project, and I highly encourage any team to checkout these scouting apps and try them for themselves.

# Features
    - Online/Offline use
    - Customizable dashboard
    - Minimal formatting required
    - Comparison between teams

# Supported Platforms

Any CSV file with any amount of columns and rows can be supported. The only formatting you have to do is just make sure there are no null columns in the data.

# Usage

Steps to use:
1. Upload the CSV file
2. Select the data format you want
3. follow the instructions to use the format
4. save and view your changes.
You can apply changes to all teams or just that one team. Each team will get a dashboard that you can customize using the steps above. Heavily inspired from [SPOT's](https://github.com/HuskieRobotics/SPOT) analysis page.

# Online/Offline 

If you want to compare your collected data to online sources such as [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/), you need to be online. However, you can still use this tool in offline you just won't be able to compare your data with online data sources.
